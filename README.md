Technologies used: HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, Express, Method-Override, Body-Parser, Express-Sessions, and Bcrypt.

Approach:

Users can create an account, login and create workout posts, edit profile and posts, and delete profile and posts.
add flash cards to their topics
- Users can also browse other use's posts and profiles.
- Full RESTful routes for the workouts model.
- MongoDB used as database and Mongoose for database queries
- bcrypt used for password encryption
- express-sessions used for user login.
